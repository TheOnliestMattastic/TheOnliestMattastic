# 👋 Oh, Hello! — I'm Matthew | @TheOnliestMattastic

Welcome to my page! I'm a solo **indie game developer** and **IT support** candidate who turns curiosity into working systems and playable worlds. I grew up glued to my computer screen and channeled that obsession into building and upgrading desktops, learning Windows inside out, and now developing an open-world RPG in Unreal Engine with C++.  

I’m **CompTIA A+ certified**, a lifelong self-learner, and a tinkerer who loves finding problems, fixing them, and documenting the process so others can learn too.  

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 👾 Open-World RPG (Work in Progress)  
> My passion project: a solo-developed RPG in Unreal Engine (C++). Currently building gameplay systems, experimenting with procedural encounters, and documenting the dev roadmap.  
**Tech:** Unreal Engine · C++ · Blender · Krita  
*(Repo coming soon with roadmap, screenshots, and devlog notes.)*

### 📊 Impact of Tobacco on BP & HR  
> Undergraduate research project analyzing how smoking intensity influences blood pressure and heart rate, with emphasis on **data visualization, statistical modeling, and reproducible reporting**.  
**Tech:** R · ggplot2 · R Markdown   
[![Live_Site](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live_Report-2980b9?style=for-the-badge&logo=githubpages&logoSize=auto&labelColor=gray)](https://theonliestmattastic.github.io/Psychology-Research-Impact-of-Tobacco-on-BP-and-HR/) 
[![Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code-GitHub-44475a?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoSize=auto&lColor=gray)](https://github.com/theonliestmattastic/Psychology-Research-Impact-of-Tobacco-on-BP-and-HR)

### 🧰 My Bash Toolkit  
> A curated collection of custom Bash scripts designed to **streamline everyday system tasks**—because life’s too short to babysit your filesystem. Each script is documented for **portability, clarity, and reuse**.  
**Tech:** Bash · Rclone · cron

## ✨ Skills & Interests

- **Game Development:** Unreal Engine, C++, gameplay systems, asset pipelines  
- **Systems & Support:** CompTIA A+, desktop/laptop build & upgrade, OS installs, recovery  
- **Programming & Scripting:** Bash, C++, Markdown, HTML/CSS, Python (familiar), PowerShell (learning)  
- **Platform Fluency:** Linux power user; comfortable across Windows and macOS  
- **Other interests:** Video & board games, longboarding/skateboarding, anime, satire (Trey Parker & Matt Stone, Matt Groening, John Oliver), human rights & economic justice  

## 🔍 Current Focus

- Polishing repo branding and READMEs to clearly show problem-solving and impact  
- Expanding automation coverage for routine support tasks and deployment workflows  
- Developing my open-world RPG in Unreal Engine (C++ gameplay systems, devlog roadmap)  
- Keeping a cohesive visual identity across repos: ASCII headers, badges, and README cards  

## ⚖️ Values

I care about clear education, fair wages, and the struggle against class and income inequality. I bring those values into collaborative projects, documentation that reduces barriers to entry, and code that’s meant to teach as much as it runs.
